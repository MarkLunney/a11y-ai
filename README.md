Demo code for Improving Accessibility with Machine Learning, a talk I will be giving at the March 2020 [VanJS meetup](https://www.meetup.com/vancouver-javascript-developers/events/268982500/).

This project uses [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) to auto-generate alt tags and aria labels for images using image analysis and text recognition.
